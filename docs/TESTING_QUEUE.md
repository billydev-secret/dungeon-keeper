# Testing Queue

Changes that pass pytest + the fake-driven smoke checks but still need a
**live-server** pass before we fully trust them (Discord API behaviour that
can't be exercised offline). Move an item to the bottom "Done" section once
it's been verified in the dev guild, with a date.

### `/setup` DM-delivered config wizard  — committed 042c95e (2026-07-10)

The `/setup` wizard now DMs the admin who runs it instead of showing an
in-channel ephemeral wizard. Rebuilt on hand-populated StringSelects (native
role/channel selects don't populate in a DM). Unit tests + fake-driven smoke
cover the logic and both code paths, but the Discord-side delivery needs a
live pass:

- [ ] Run `/setup` in the dev guild → confirm the bot DMs you and the channel
      reply says "Check your DMs".
- [ ] Walk all six steps; confirm each writes to the **correct guild's**
      config (check per-guild, now that we're multi-guild).
- [ ] Verify the `Configuring: <guild>` footer shows the right server.
- [ ] Test on a guild with **>25 roles** → the ◀ ▶ pagination appears and
      multi-select picks accumulate across pages.
- [ ] Test the **DMs-closed** fallback (disable DMs from server members) →
      `/setup` should fall back to the in-channel wizard, not silently fail.
- [ ] Confirm skipping a step (picking nothing) leaves existing config intact.
- [ ] Sanity-check the 3s ACK: in a cold DM channel the `defer` should keep
      the interaction alive even when opening the DM is slow.
